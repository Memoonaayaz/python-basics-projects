# python-basics-projects
Mini Python projects (Mad Libs, Circle Calculator, Hypotenuse Finder) built while learning the basics.
A collection of simple Python projects I created while learning the fundamentals of programming. These small scripts cover math, input/output, string formatting, and basic logic — each one practices a new concept.

---

## 📂 Projects Included
- **Mad Libs Game ** → A fun word game where the user inputs different words (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) and the program generates a silly story.  
  *Concepts used:* `input()`, string concatenation, f-strings.  

- **Circle Circumference Calculator 🔵** → Calculates the circumference of a circle using the radius provided by the user.  
  *Concepts used:* `math.pi`, user input, rounding, f-strings.  

- **Circle Area Calculator ⚪** → Calculates the area of a circle based on the radius.  
  *Concepts used:* `math.pi`, `pow()`, rounding, formatted output.  

- **Hypotenuse Finder 📐 → Uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.  
  *Concepts used:* `math.sqrt()`, `pow()`, multiple inputs.

## What I Learned

- Taking input from the user with input().
- Using built-in Python modules (math).
- String formatting with f-strings.
- Applying formulas in code (geometry + Pythagoras).
- Organizing multiple scripts in one project.

  ##  Next Steps
I plan to add more small Python projects as I continue learning.
